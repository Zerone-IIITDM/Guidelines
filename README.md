# Zerone-IIITDM

**Zerone-IIITDM** is an Open Source Community started by Zerone Club of IIITDM Kancheepuram to spread the idea of Open Source among students and help them contribute to Open Source. We welcome newcomers who are completely new to open source and help them start their Open Source Journey.

Start by looking at the repositories at https://github.com/Zerone-IIITDM. Select a repo that you find interesting and pickup one of the issues that seems suitable. But even before that you can join our [#Zerone-IIITDM/general](https://github.com/Zerone-IIITDM) Slack channel and talk with us. So just drop by and say a Hi!

If you are a newcomer we recommend choosing a `difficulty/newcomer` issue to get started.
